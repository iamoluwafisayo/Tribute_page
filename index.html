                certainty that the agony and protests of those who
                suffer injustice shall give way to peace and human
                dignity. The children of the world shall know the great
                work of this extraordinary leader and his fervent
                mission to right wrong, to do justice, and to serve
                mankind. The enemies which imperil the future of
                generations to come: poverty, ignorance, disease,
                hunger, and racism have each seen effects of the
                Awards and honours
                Personal life
                Philanthropy
                valiant work of Chief Abiola. Through him and others
                like him, never again will freedom rest in the domain
                of the few. We, the members of the Congressional
                Black Caucus salute him this day as a hero in the
                global pursuit to preserve the history and the legacy of
                the African diaspora.
